Based on excerices outputs and findings while doing it containers share:
Network: Hosts ip and port and network recources and settings. 
Cpu: Host and containers share same Cpu recources. When you run containers it takes cpu from host.
Memory: Containers share hosts memory recources.
Disk: Containers share hosts disk recources.
You can limit each of these, but I think on default it uses as much it needs.
